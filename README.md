## How I build this website?
So this is a [react](https://www.react.dev/) based website which I built using **claude.ai**. Of course I dont have the frontend skills but personally I believe that's fine, as long as I am working with other relevant stacks.
I atleast had the shame to write the whole code manually as copy-pasting felt like I was commiting a **sin** the world of code.
I am not sure if there is a proper way to give credits, so....
> This code was generated by an AI tool known as **Claude** using Sonnet-4 LLM. Please refer to its original [website](https://www.claude.ai/) for more details.
